Danial started as a brilliant Al/ML expert, quickly grew into a capable Al and backend engineer, and ultimately became a well rounded Al and full stack engineer.\n\nDanial possesses very sharp technical knowledge and expertise in AI/ML and backend technologies. What truly sets him apart is his readiness to take on any challenge, his curiosity to learn, and his determination to master new domains, including frontend development, where he made remarkable progress in a short time.\n\nHe is punctual, effective, and upfront, always addressing discussions directly and constructively. Danial's calm and thoughtful approach allows him to step back, understand a project's full context, and then propose the most suitable solution.
